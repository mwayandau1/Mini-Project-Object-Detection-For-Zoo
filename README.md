**# Mini-Project-Object-Detection-For-Zoo**

This is a computer vision project build for tracking zoo animal in the zoo environment. 
The uses the state of the-state-of-the-art computer vision algorithm Yolov8. Being trained on large dataset, it is able to track zoo animal with accuracy and efficiency.

**Technology stack:**
Python: The programming language on which the project is build
Yolov8: The new state of the art algorithm for training the model 
Flask: Python web framework on which the computer vision application is integrated into the web 
HTML and CSS: For the structure of the web pages and styling the web pages
